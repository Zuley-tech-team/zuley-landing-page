2️⃣ SILVER SOURCING & STANDARDS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONTENT STRATEGY:
-----------------
SECTION HEADLINE:
"The Silver Standard: 925 Sterling"

SUBHEADLINE:
"Why we only use authentic 925 sterling silver"

MAIN CONTENT:
-------------
WHAT IS 925 STERLING SILVER?

"925 sterling silver is the international benchmark for quality silver products. 
The number '925' means the metal is 92.5% pure silver, alloyed with 7.5% 
copper for strength and durability.

This precise composition creates the perfect balance:
• Pure enough to maintain silver's natural beauty and antimicrobial properties
• Strong enough for daily use without bending or breaking
• Durable enough to last generations with proper care
• Valuable enough to appreciate over time

We source our silver from certified suppliers who meet international standards. 
Every batch is tested for purity, and every finished piece carries the official 
925 hallmark—your guarantee of authenticity."

WHY NOT PURE SILVER (99.9%)?
"Pure silver is too soft for functional products. It bends easily and wears 
quickly. The 7.5% copper alloy in 925 sterling silver provides the strength 
needed for everyday items while maintaining silver's premium qualities."

WHY NOT SILVER-PLATED?
"Silver-plated items have only a thin layer of silver over base metal. This 
plating wears off over time, exposing the cheaper metal underneath. Our solid 
925 sterling silver goes all the way through—it will never wear off or tarnish 
to reveal a different metal."

HALLMARK CERTIFICATION:
"Every piece is stamped with the official '925' hallmark, certifying its 
purity. This mark is your guarantee that you're receiving authentic sterling 
silver, not an imitation."

6-STEP PROCESS:
---------------
STEP 1: DESIGN & PROTOTYPING
"Every product begins with careful design. We create detailed technical 
drawings and prototypes, refining every dimension until perfect."

Visual: Design sketches, CAD models, prototype photos

---

STEP 2: SILVER PREPARATION
"We start with certified 925 sterling silver ingots. The silver is melted, 
purified, and formed into workable sheets or rods at precise temperatures."

Visual: Melting process, silver ingots, temperature control

---

STEP 3: SHAPING & FORMING
"Our skilled artisans shape the silver using traditional silversmithing 
techniques combined with modern precision tools. Each piece is carefully 
formed to exact specifications."

Visual: Artisan working, shaping tools, work-in-progress pieces

---

STEP 4: ASSEMBLY & FINISHING
"Components are assembled with precision. The piece is then polished to 
achieve the desired finish—mirror-like polish, brushed matte, or oxidized 
vintage look."

Visual: Assembly process, polishing, different finishes

---

STEP 5: ENGRAVING (If Personalized)
"For personalized pieces, we use precision laser engraving technology. Your 
text or logo is engraved with micrometer accuracy, creating permanent, 
detailed impressions."

Visual: Laser engraving in action, close-up of engraving detail

---

STEP 6: QUALITY CHECK & HALLMARKING
"Every piece undergoes rigorous quality inspection. We check dimensions, 
finish quality, mechanism function, and engraving accuracy. Only then is it 
stamped with the 925 hallmark and approved for packaging."

Visual: Quality inspector, hallmark stamping, approved pieces

4️⃣ ENGRAVING TECHNOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONTENT STRATEGY:
-----------------
SECTION HEADLINE:
"Precision Laser Engraving"

SUBHEADLINE:
"Your words, permanently etched in silver"

MAIN CONTENT:
-------------
TECHNOLOGY:
"We use state-of-the-art fiber laser engraving technology, capable of 
reproducing text and logos with exceptional detail and precision.

Unlike traditional mechanical engraving, laser engraving:
• Creates perfectly consistent depth and clarity
• Reproduces complex logos and fine details
• Ensures permanent results that won't fade
• Allows for various font styles and sizes
• Completes quickly without compromising quality"

PROCESS:
"Your design is converted to a digital file and loaded into our laser system. 
The laser beam removes a microscopic layer of silver, creating a permanent 
impression. The depth is precisely controlled to ensure visibility without 
compromising the product's integrity."

CAPABILITIES:
• Text: Any font, up to 50 characters
• Logos: Vector files (AI, EPS, SVG) for best results
• Depth: 0.05mm to 0.15mm (adjustable)
• Precision: ±0.01mm accuracy
• Speed: Most engravings complete in 2-5 minutes

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
"Every engraving is inspected under magnification to ensure perfect clarity, 
alignment, and depth. If it doesn't meet our standards, we redo it."
